Tor is an important tool providing privacy and anonymity online. The property of anonymity itself is more than just providing an encrypted connection between the source and the destination of a given conversation. Encryption only prevents the content of the communication between Alice and Bob from becoming known. Onion Services offer bidirectional anonymity through Tor "rendezvous points," other Tor users can connect to these onion services each without knowing the other's network identity, just by sharing the onion service address. This talk is going to explain how we built a desktop app to allow users to start onion services with a click and share a website or a web app from their computer.
