This demo is about creating and running ephemeral .onion services to share websites or simple web applications. We present different use cases for onion services and a wrapper app that allows you to start a .onion and start sharing a static website or a web application. Because .onion services live on the Tor network, you do not need hosting or a public ip address to offer some service via .onion address. The .onion is hosted on your computer for the time you desire, allowing the people visiting your site to remain anonymous, and also you. We believe anonymity to be very important since it can free people, allowing them to decide how to expose themselves or to make themselves visible on their own terms.
