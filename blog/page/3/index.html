    <p>How can small organization run relays on the Tor network while sustain their operations</p>
<h1 id="how-is-the-tor-network-composed">How is the Tor network composed</h1><p>The Tor network consists entirely of relays run by volunteers, providing bandwidth and other services to Tor users. There are currently about 6000 relays sustaining the network [1].
Up to now the Tor network has grown organically, by the mean of community outreach activities. Tor relay operators are usually individuals that are motivated by various factors. The Tor project mission itself is a strong driver for individuals interested in providing privacy enhancing communication tools to people all over the world. Other relay operators might be researchers interested in the technical aspects of the Tor software and protocol. Others can also simply be open source entusiasts that want to be part of its community. Many relay operators have often been recruited, so to speak, by other community members or core developers. Finally some relay operators are adversaries that are trying to run different analysis over the Tor network itself, like collecting information on its use or on the content being transferred.</p>
<p>All the motivations described above do not require direct compensation by the Tor Project and the volunteer-based approach to sustain the network has been proved successful. Relay operators do not only invest their hardware, but also time and commitment in running the relays and in being part of the Tor community. Expenading the set of relays is vital for the Tor network. More importantly the network needs a diverse set of relay, not just advertised bandwidth. Diversity means different hardware and operating systems, but also different locations across the globe in order to reach users worldwide and offer overall the same quality of service.</p>
<p>Throughout Tor history, there have never been in place an official mechanism for relay operators to be rewarded extrinsically. The intrinsic reward of being a relay operator was the social perceived value, like recognition within the Tor community. Many different proposals have been made for a Tor incentives system [2], but none has ever been implemented.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-relay-operators-organize">How do relay operators organize</h1><p>Relay operators sometimes create a small non profit or join an umbrella organization, to support their activities. These are setup so that the individual operators are not legally responsible in case of a legal dispute. Also the organization is setup to share the burden of possible legal expenses and to collect donations for their activities. The Tor Project itself advises people to constitute a non-profit organization responsible for the relays in case of possible legal disputes.
There are some legal risks in fact associated with running relays. These are usually not different from the same risks that an ISP could have since both relay internet traffic. Exits relays have more legal concerns that bridges, guards or middle relays, because middles and guards only relay encrypted traffic, while exits performs requests to the open internet.
The Tor Project provides some standard response letters that relay operators can use and some legal resources that could become handy. In any case relay operators are advised to consult with a lawyer if any problem with law enforcement should arise.</p>
<h1 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-run-a-relay">How much does it cost to run a relay</h1><p>Running a relay can be as cheap as a few dollars per month and as expensive as a few hundred, depending on where the relay runs, which kind of hardware it's running on, bandwidth, operating system and so on. Most relays operators rely on donations from individuals that want to contribute to the network but for several reasons are not able to run a relay at the moment. There is again intrinsic value to donate to relay operators to contribute to the Tor community.</p>
<p>A big portion of relay costs are taken over by bandwidth consumption. If an individual or group wants to run a node that relays a lot of traffic, bandwidth might become expensive.</p>
<h1 id="participatory-business-models-for-off-grid-utilities-what-can-we-learn">Participatory Business Models for Off-Grid utilities, what can we learn</h1><p>Certain mechanisms developed by and for the maintenance and operations of the Tor network have much in common with off-grid utility implementation. To start both are ipso-facto decentralized, community based and require experimenting with different business models for implementation.</p>
<p>A number  of  previous  studies  have  developed  their  own  classifications  for electrification models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercially  led  models which  are  driven  by  suppliers  and  dealers  with relatively little government control.</li>
<li>Multi-stakeholder programmatic model wherein a project management unit or multi-stakeholder management authority is typically charged with reaching consumers.</li>
<li>Utility model typically operates on a fee-for-service basis.</li>
<li>Grant  based  models.</li>
</ul>
<p>[3] describes different participatory models for off-grid electricity services in rural areas. Drawing  from  previous defined  classification  systems,  they identify  five  models  with  different types of operations that have been used in rural electrification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Co-operatives;</li>
<li>Service distribution franchises;</li>
<li>Fee-for-service models;</li>
<li>Community managed models; and</li>
<li>Private sector models.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that differentiate the ecosystem of companies and cooperatives providing utilities and relay operators is the fact that while utility providing organizations could in theory charge its users for using their network, the Tor network is freely accessible by everyone running a Tor client. Since neither the Tor Project nor any reasonable relay operator would like to charge Tor users for bandwidth used, in the past people have speculated whether it would make sense to build mechanisms so that the network could reward relays for the bandwidth provided to the network. A part of this speculation has also involved considering possible harms of such mechanism to both the privacy and security of Tor users and the community of relay operators. For example some have argued that this could encourage bad or malicious relays, or the growth of relay farms with the only interest to cash out instead of maintaining the network and protecting the privacy of its users.</p>
<p>Some relay operators groups have developed a membership model to help sustain their operations [4] [5]. The membership model allows such group to build a close relationship with their supporters while also sustaining their operations.</p>
<h1 id="running-a-participatory-relay-community">Running a participatory relay community</h1><p>While relay operators cannot be directly compensated by Tor users directly, they could be compensated for offering other services in a participatory way to the community of Tor users and .onion websites.
The relay operators group could add a certain fee to the service offered and redirect part of this compensation to sustaining their infrastructure and work in maintaining the Tor network. This mechanism could help both the relay operators and the Tor network itself in more than one way. One the one hand relay operators can build a relationship with their members by offering a set of privacy friendly services that might or might not use the Tor network itself to be operated, like bridges, .onion hosting, vpn, and so on. On the other hand the Tor project will benefit by seeing more diverse use of the Tor network. Finally, this could also be an incentive for creating a better experience for onion services developers and operators and therefore fostering a more
legitimate onion service ecosystem.</p>
<p>This mechanism could be easier to implement for some relay operators that other form of financing, simply because they are already running some of these services as these are needed for day-to-day operations. For example many operators group running exit are already running an authoritative dns and could easily offer this service to their members (some in fact already do). This might actually be easier in many circumstances than applying for international grants or public funding, since in many cases this suppose a big overhead in work that small relay operators group cannot sustain.</p>

    </p>
    <p>I use yubikeys to store my gpg and ssh keys.</p>
<p>Before starting do a little bit of reading to familiarize yourself with the setup
procedure.
I have added a list of links at the end. These are mainly the resources that I used.</p>
<h2 id="generate-a-new-gpg-key">Generate a new gpg key</h2><p>I have generated my keys on a qube VM without internet connection.</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --gen-key
</code></pre>
<p>Selected option 0 and moved on to create my ID associated with the key.</p>
<p>In this step I used mostly the guide from yubico developers website [1]
The guide goes through generating Sign (S) Authentication (A) and Encryption (E)
keys.</p>
<h2 id="add-an-authentication-key">Add an authentication key</h2><pre><code>$ gpg --expert --edit-key 123ABC45
</code></pre>
<p>At this step we select another RSA key to attach to our key. In the gpg selection
menu this corresponds to option 8.</p>
<h2 id="backup">Backup</h2><p>Here is where you should backup your keys and revocation certificates. Please do
I have personally lost yubikeys and having backups really helps.</p>
<p>Also setup a PIN and a admin PIN for your yubikey [5]. With:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --card-edit

$ gpg/card&gt; admin
</code></pre>
<h2 id="import-the-key-to-the-yubikey">Import the key to the yubikey</h2><p>Finally we edit our key and add it to the keycard [1].</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --expert --edit-key 123ABC45

$ gpg&gt; keytocard
</code></pre>
<p>Now your key is exported to your card and ready to be used.</p>
<h2 id="setup-key-to-be-used-with-ssh">Setup key to be used with ssh</h2><pre><code>$ gpg2 -K --with-keygrip
</code></pre>
<p>This will show all your keys available with keygrip.
Use the keygrip of your authentication key to export it to <code>sshcontrol</code></p>
<pre><code>echo 1234567AB8CDFFF90G9H1I23JJ4K5L67M89N012O &gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
</code></pre>
<p>I have also added the following to my <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> [4]:</p>
<pre><code>default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
enable-ssh-support
write-env-file ~/.gpg-agent-info
</code></pre>
<p>And edited my <code>~/.bashrc</code> with:</p>
<pre><code>gpg-connect-agent /bye
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
</code></pre>
<p>You can now:</p>
<pre><code>$ source ~/.bashrc
$ ssh-add -l
</code></pre>
<p>This should list your new key.</p>

      <h2><a href="/blog/2019-06-21-solid-tor-onion-services/">Using Solid with Tor .onion services. How to decentralise your online identities</a></h2>

    <p>A lot of information is given away by certain properties of communications beyond just the content. These properties are usually referred to as communication metadata. Metadata include information such as the lenght of the conversation, who was involved, where are the parties involved in the conversation located, and so on.</p>
<p>Questions that can be answered by looking at metadata are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long you talk, how often ...</li>
<li>the people you talk to, or a group of people that communicate between eachothers frequently ...</li>
<li>network addresses, traffic patterns</li>
<li>location services, geo-coding ...</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see Metadata give a lot away about you even if the actual content of your communication is encrypted. We could also say that the metadata can give away more information than reading the actual content, and in a form that is easily processed by machines.</p>
<p>Tor is an important tool providing privacy and anonymity online. The property of anonymity itself is more than just providing an encrypted connection between the source and the destination of a given conversation. Encryption only prevents the content of the communication between two parties from becoming known, but there is a lot of information that can still be learned by just observing the traffic.</p>
<p>When you use the Tor network, you are not sharing your communication metadata. So that, not only your communication are encrypted, but you can also stay anonymous. Anonymity is a broad concept, and it can mean different things to different groups.</p>
<p>The main advertised property of the Tor network is that it provides strong anonymity given a variety of people using the network.
For the Tor network to function properly and to satisfy users' needs, we need a certain degree of diversity. We need diversity in the relays comprising the network and in the user population sending traffic through it. We want Tor to be able to reach and serve a diverse population of users and use cases. We believe everyone should be able to browse the web and enjoy privacy, independently of where they live and who they are.</p>
<p>But hiding network traffic is not all you have to do to be protect websites and services from tracking you online. There is a lot of information that is given away when you use your google or facebook accounts to login to a third party service.</p>
<p>The risk in this case doesn't only involve you transferring your profile information to a third party service, but also Facebook and Google learning about how and which third party services you use.</p>
<p>Tor provides a technology called onion services that allows users to offer various kinds of services, such as web publishing or an instant messaging server making that available on the Tor network. Using Tor "rendezvous points," other Tor users can connect to these .onion services, formerly known as hidden services, each without knowing the other's network identity.</p>
<p>An .onion service needs to advertise its existence in the Tor network before clients will be able to contact it. Therefore, the service randomly picks some relays, builds circuits to them, and asks them to act as introduction points by telling them its public key. By using a full Tor circuit, it's hard for anyone to associate an introduction point with the .onion server's IP address. While the introduction points and others are told the onion service's identity (public key), we don't want them to learn about the onion server's location (IP address).</p>
<p>In a-not-so imaginary more privacy friendly web, applications could be made available through onion services and we could use different identity providers that wouldn't necessarly need to access and share all our data, therefore without us losing control over our online footprints.</p>
<p>Recently I have have learned about Solid. Solid can be defined as a set of protocols leveraging on the idea of the semantic web to allow online applications to access user data. Building on top of hypermedia protocols, Solid is completely compatible with the current technologies of the web.
With Solid all your data are stored in an online Solid Pod. The data is owned by the user who is always free to move it as they wanted.</p>
<p>Users can give other users or services permission to read or write to their POD. This approach is great for services' developers while also protecting user privacy. Ultimately the user retains control on their pod.</p>
<p>I have created a test application running on onion services and connecting to a solid community pod. This example is particularly interesting, because by using the .onion protocol the solid pod doesn't know about the app retrieving data. They will just see their .onion address.</p>
<p>The code is available via the <a href="https://github.com/hiromipaw/myonion">myonion wrapper</a>. An experiment in making available through docker containers different app via .onion services.</p>
<p>In this post I have shown how a web application made available through .onion on the Tor network can exchange information with a Solid pod and allow a user to login and share some data. Because .onion services live on the Tor network, you do not need hosting or a public ip address to offer some service via .onion address. This means .onion services are a gateway to a decentralised, peer-to-peer internet, where you regain control on the content you create and who you are sharing it with. The .onion can even be hosted on your computer for the time you desire, allowing the people using your service to remain anonymous, and also you.</p>
<p>I believe anonymity to be very important since it can free people, allowing them to decide how to expose themselves or to make themselves visible on their own terms.</p>
