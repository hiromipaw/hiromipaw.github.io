We investigate the effects of different privacy enhancing technologies in content-based recommendation systems.

We study the interplay between the degree of privacy and the potential degradation of the quality of the recommendation.

We evaluate three different tag forgery strategies: optimised tag forgery, uniform tag forgery and TrackMeNot.

We carry out an experimental evaluation on a real dataset extracted from Delicious.
