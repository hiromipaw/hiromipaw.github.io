<p>I am a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, EU.</p>

<p>I am currently working at <a href="https://torproject.org">torproject.org</a> and I am also part of the Information Security Group in the Department of Telematics Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) as Ph.D. candidate, where I research topics in the fields of privacy and anonymity of users in online communities and social networks.</p>
