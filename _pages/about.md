I am a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, EU.

I am currently working at [torproject.org](https://torproject.org) and I am also part of the Information Security Group in the Department of Telematics Engineering at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC) where I got my Ph.D. I research topics in the fields of privacy and anonymity of users in online communities and social networks.

My current research interest are focused towards understanding what kind of information are publicly accessible online as result of users activities on social networks. I am also interested in RESTful architecture and application of hypermedia to Privacy and Security.

I like: surfing, swimming, skiing, mountainering and hiking. I have got a dog and two cats. If we were still in the '90s I would have displayed here my geek code.
